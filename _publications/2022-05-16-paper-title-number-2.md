**Abstract**: Electrorheological (ER) technology is an advanced technology based on ER effects. The most common material in ER technology is an electrorheological fluid (ERF), which is a type of smart soft material. The viscosity of ERF is reversibly adjustable by an applied electric field. A new type of electroresponsive soft material, electrorheological elastomer (ERE), which is a derivative of ERFs, has attracted wide attention due to its advantages of not precipitating and easy packaging. ER materials are widely applied in mechanical engineering due to their reversibly tunable characteristics, fast response, and low energy consumption. In addition to basic ER material fabrication and application, ER technology is also used in energy material preparation, oil transportation, and energy storage. The application of ER technology in the energy field provides a good example of the potential applications of ER technology in other fields. This article systematically summarizes the research status and future development prospects of ER technology in materials, energy, and mechanical engineering from the mechanism to application, combined with the latest research results.
